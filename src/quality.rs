//! Judging whether a captured region is sharp enough for text recognition.
//!
//! A blurred capture and a crisp one look alike to the rest of the pipeline:
//! OCR simply returns wrong text, and every downstream layer faithfully
//! reports the wrong answer. That failure is expensive to diagnose by hand —
//! it was reached here only after testing two OCR engines across a dozen
//! preprocessing variants before the input itself turned out to be at fault.
//!
//! So the library measures its own input. UI text is a pixel font:
//! rendered natively, a glyph edge is a single-pixel jump from background to
//! full brightness. Rescaling or video compression averages those jumps into
//! ramps, and once the ramp is wider than the stroke the glyph's identity is
//! gone — no recogniser can recover it.
//!
//! ```text
//!   native      blurred
//!   ▁▁███▁▁     ▁▂▅██▅▂▁
//!   hard edge   ramp: information lost
//! ```
//!
//! The metric is the share of strong luminance steps that are *abrupt*.
